A collection of my projects using data analysis tools with Python. Included a folder of .py files, with executable scripts, and pdfs for ease of readability. 

## FoodHub Project
**_Python - Foundations_**

The food aggregator company FoodHub had stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. I analyzed the data to draw actionable insights for the business. Performed exploratory data analysis to find answers to key questions posed that will help the company to improve their business practices. 

**Skills and Tools:**
Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python

<br />

## E-news Express Project
**_Business Statistics_**

This project used statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page of an online news portal (E-news Express) was effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. The simulated dataset had certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page that helped conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. Apart from that, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language was also analyzed in this project.

**Skills and Tools:**
Hypothesis Testing, a/b testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference

## ReCell Project
**_Supervised Learning - Foundations_**

Analyzed the used devices dataset, built a model which helped develop a dynamic pricing strategy for used and refurbished devices, and identified factors that significantly influenced the price.

**Skills and Tools:**
EDA, Linear Regression, Linear Regression assumptions, Business insights and recommendations

<br />

## INN Hotels Project
**_Supervised Learning - Classification_**

Analyzed the data of INN Hotels to find which factors had a high influence on booking cancellations, built a predictive model that could predict which booking was going to be canceled in advance, and helped in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.

**Skills and Tools:**
EDA, Data Pre-processing, Logistic regression, Multicollinearity, Finding optimal threshold using AUC-ROC curve, Decision trees, Pruning

<br />

## EasyVisa Project
**_Ensemble Techniques_**

Analyzed the data of Visa applicants, built a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influenced the Visa status, recommended a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.

**Skills and Tools:**
EDA, Data Preprocessing, Customer Profiling, Bagging Classifiers (Bagging and Random Forest), Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost,Gradient Boosting),
Stacking Classifier, Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV, Business insights

<br />

## ReneWind Project
**_Model Tuning_**

"ReneWind" is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of wind energy using machine learning and collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using sensors. Built various classification models, tuned them and found the best one that helped identify failures so that the generator could be repaired before failing/breaking and the overall maintenance cost of the generators could be brought down.

**Skills and Tools:**
EDA, Up and downsampling, Regularization, Hyperparameter tuning

<br />

## Trade&Ahead Project
**_Ensemble Techniques_**

Analyzed the stocks data, grouping the stocks based on the attributes provided, and shared insights about the characteristics of each group.

**Skills and Tools:**
EDA, Kmeans Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Cluster Profiling
